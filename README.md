Objects for interfacing a Parallax Propeller microcontroller to an iRobot Roomba or Create

This project is intended to create a higher-level interface on top of the Create Open Interface and Serial Command Interface, using the Propeller multi-core microcontroller to implement a small, fast, and simple framework that works across Roomba models.
